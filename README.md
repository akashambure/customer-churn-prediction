# RetainAI: Leveraging ML to Boost Customer Retention

## Description
RetainAI is a data science project aimed at addressing customer churn in a telecom company. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building a predictive model, and evaluating its performance, this project seeks to provide actionable insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

## Project Flow

### Data Pre-processing & Exploratory Data Analysis

### Feature Selection

**chi-square test**
```python
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
# chi-square test for area code and churn
crosstab_result = pd.crosstab(df['area code'], df['churn'])
chi2, p_value, dof, expec = chi2_contingency(crosstab_result)
print(p_value)
```
**One Way ANOVA**
```python
from scipy.stats import f_oneway

def one_way_anova_for_churn(feature):
    """
    Perform one-way ANOVA to test the relationship between a numerical feature and churn.
   
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame containing the data.
    feature (str): The name of the numerical feature to test.
   
    Returns:
    str: 'Has Relation' if the p-value is <= 0.05, otherwise 'No Relation'.
    """
    # Create groups based on the 'churn' feature
    group_false = df[df['churn'] == False][feature]
    group_true = df[df['churn'] == True][feature]
   
    # Perform the one-way ANOVA
    f_stat, p_value = f_oneway(group_false, group_true)
   
    # Return results
    if p_value <= 0.05:
        return 'Has Relation'
    return 'No Relation'
```
**Correlation Analysis**
```python
df.corr()['churn']
```

### Model Building & Evaluation
```python
def train_eval_model(model):
   
    '''
    This function train & Evaluate the given model
   
    '''
    model.fit(X_train, y_train) # training
    y_pred_test = model.predict(X_test) #  test prediction
    y_pred_train = model.predict(X_train) #  training prediction
   
    print('\n',type(model).__name__)
   
    print('=='*25)
    print('\nTraining Accuracy :', accuracy_score(y_train, y_pred_train)) # training accuracy
    print('\nTest Accuracy :', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_test)) # test accuracy
    print('__'*25)
    print('\nConfusion Matrix:\n\n', confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_test)) # confusion matrix
    print('__'*25)
    print('\nClassification Report: \n')
   
    return  classification_report(y_test, y_pred_test) # classification report
```
## Contribution Guidelines
